title: Week 10
---

I can't believe it's week 10 already (I counted week 0 as week 1 so the timing is off a bit). I still have next week and finals week to continue cataloging and wrap things up. I had an interview for a job this past weekend so Cate and I talked through some of the things I would potentially be cataloging in this position and she showed me how to catalog a music score, which is something they mentioned. If I have time next week then I will try one on my own. 
She also showed me how to catalog an archival collection, which is once again very different from the other things I've worked on. Unlike books and sound recordings, you never actually see the archival collection, instead you're working from a finding aid, and from a MARC record generated from that finding aid. Archival collections can take a lot of time to do well, because there can be a lot of information that goes into the 5XX note fields about the collection, so Cate and I just went through doing subject analysis and assigning subject headings for the record we looked at. I am going to work on one myself as well and she will take a look next week.
I've been improving on my sound recording cataloging. I've done quite a few original records at this point as well as upgrading some AACR2 recordings to RDA. I'm hoping to get to 15 sound recording records before the end of the quarter, and maybe 2 archival collections, which are the goals we set in my learning outcomes.
