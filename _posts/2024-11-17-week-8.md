title: Week 8
---

I continued cataloging music this week, along with doing some ETDs. Unfortunately I was sick so I wasn't able to come in to the library at all, but I had plenty to work on from home. 
One of the CDs I had grabbed was actually a duplicate, so I only had one CD to work on, but I took my time on it and did my best to upgrade the record from AACR2 to RDA. I had fun listening to the album on Spotify while I worked as well.

Based on Cate's advice during our midterm review, I've been trying to keep an eye on time while I do subject analysis for the ETDs I am working on, and aiming for about 30 minutes. I think I'm doing pretty well, and I made good progress, but I also find it takes quite a bit of time for me to do the Wikidata work, and if I'm doing Name Authority work, that takes time as well. I am very much feeling pressed for time with the quarter coming to an end quickly, but I am learning so much. 

I don't have much else to add this week. Next week I will meet with Cate again, but then she is out of office for a few days, so I'll be back on my own.
