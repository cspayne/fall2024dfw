title: Week 11
---

It's the final week of the quarter, and almost the end of my DFW experience. This week was mostly spent finishing up CD cataloging and meeting with Cate to review what my completed records. I've come a long way and many times the records I create look good, but there are still small things, such as when to include punctuation and how to capitalize things that I need to remember. 

Cate is going to finish up reviewing my completed ETD bib records, NARs, and Wikidata items so that I can get those uploaded, and I am going to finish up a few more CDs and one more archival collection record next week.

Overall, this has been an amazing experience. I've gotten some great opportunities to learn new things and advance my skills as a cataloger, and this will be invaluable as I graduate and head into the field.
