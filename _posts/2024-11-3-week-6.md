title: Week 6
---

This week I had my midterm review with Cate. Overall I am doing well and picking up what I need to know to create Wikidata items, do subject analysis for ETDs, and create Name Authority Records. I have also had some opportunities that we did not initially highlight in the Learning Outcome Agreement, including attending NACO training. However, I have not made it half-way through the number of ETDs we had set as the goal, and we haven't even started music or archival collections. At the meeting we decided to count the Name Authority Records towards my overall goal, since we didn't specify this in the initial agreement. We also agreed to lower the number of Wikidata items I need to complete from 30 to 25. Overall I am really happy with the progress I have made, but I agree with Cate that I will need to get faster (although I have been assured that that comes with practice). 

I spent the rest of the week working on some ETDs, NARs, and Wikidata items, as usual. Many of the authors I encounter have unique names and I do not need to do any name authority work, but I have come across a few that require enhancement or even a new record, and I get to apply what I've learned from the NACO training. I also sent out an email to the person who's last name has changed, but we have yet to hear back. 

Next week I start music cataloging!
