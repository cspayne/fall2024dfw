In Fall 2024, as an MLIS student at the University of Washington, I will complete a quarter of Directed Fieldwork supervised by the Head of Monographic Cataloging at the University of Washington libraries. This website serves as a repository for this experience, including my learning outcomes, artifacts, and a weekly blog that I will keep during this time.
